## Documentation

Have formal documentation for your code. Particularly present near-code high level logic showing the patterns/concepts of main components. Do not rely upon examples to illustrate this as certain patterns/concepts may only exist in certain examples and will leave the user searching through examples or going through a process of trial and error to reverse engineer these patterns/concepts.
