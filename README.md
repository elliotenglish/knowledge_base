# Knowledge Base

This repository contains a collection of notes on a variety of subjects such as computational mathematics, computational geometry, physics, machine learning, artificial intellgence, and software engineering, just to name a few. It attempts to establish common nomenclature and an understanding of basic concepts, as well as address key advanced concepts that haven't been covered in commonly available sources. It has been written over time as needed when explaining concepts to collaborators, documenting equation derivativations, and trying to gain intuition. Much of the material can be found elsewhere, but this is an attempt to distill key points and enrich concepts where gaps exist.

The information is by no means perfect. If you see any errors or wish to contribute, please message the author.
